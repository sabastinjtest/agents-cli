Skills are context files installed to coding agents (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) via `agents-cli setup`. They provide domain-specific guidance for working with generated agent projects.

```bash
agents-cli setup      # Install all skills
agents-cli update     # Reinstall / update skills
```
